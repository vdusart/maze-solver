# Maze Generator and Solver

This is a small project made to continue my journey through learning Rust.

## Usage

*You need to have SDL2 installed to be able to run this script.*

Lauch the script with `cargo run`.

Once it's done you can restart the generation of the maze by entering the letter `R` on your keyboard.
